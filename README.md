# Food Image Classification Using CNN

This project focuses on classifying and enhancing the accuracy of images across **101 food categories** using a **Convolutional Neural Network (CNN)**. By implementing various **feature extraction** and **model optimization** techniques, this work builds upon the methodologies outlined in the **Food-101** research paper.

## Key Features

- **Convolutional Neural Network**: Utilizes CNN architectures to extract features from food images effectively.
- **Dataset**: Trained on the Food-101 dataset consisting of 101 different food categories.
- **Feature Extraction**: Employs advanced techniques to optimize the model's ability to discern between similar food items.
- **Model Optimization**: Incorporates various strategies to enhance the modelâ€™s performance, including fine-tuning hyperparameters and using regularization techniques.

## Results

- Achieved improved accuracy in classifying food images through various enhancements and optimizations.
- Demonstrated effectiveness of feature extraction methods in distinguishing between different food categories.
